## Taught by [Phillip Kuznetsov](https://github.com/philkuz), [Raul Puri](https://github.com/raulpuric), Humza Iqbal, James Bartlett, [Dan Geng](https://github.com/dangeng)
Data Science Decal taught at UC Berkeley Spring Semester 2017

To get started on the coursework, you'll first need to clone the repo:
```
cd <desired-directory>
git clone https://github.com/kaggledecal/sp17.git kaggledecal
```

Then you'll want to start a jupyter server from within this repo.
```
cd kaggledecal
jupyter notebook
```

## Setting up your environment
If you have not yet installed jupyter on your machine, you'll probably get an error message when you run the above command. 
### Mac OS 10.10+, Linux, and Windows 10
Use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
### Windows < 10 and Mac OS < 10.10
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
### What should I use?
Choosing either package is to your discretion; we encourage Docker because it will allow you to quickly prototype papers like [Style Transfer](https://hub.docker.com/r/kchentw/neural-style/), ([paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)).
