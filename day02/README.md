# Day 2
Introduction to numpy and scientific computing. We will be briefly going over the [intro-to-numpy](https://github.com/kaggledecal/sp17/blob/master/day02/intro-to-numpy.ipynb) and [intro-to-jupyter](https://github.com/kaggledecal/sp17/blob/master/day02/intro-to-jupyter.ipynb) notebooks during class today and then you will have a [simple assignment](https://github.com/kaggledecal/sp17/blob/master/day02/pset1.ipynb) applying some of the things you learned in this lecture.
