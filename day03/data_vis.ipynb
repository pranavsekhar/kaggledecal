    "### Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster\n",
    "\n",
    ">The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.  In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.\"\n",

    "Above is a summary of our data contained in a `Pandas` `DataFrame`. Think of a `DataFrame` as a Python's super charged version of the workflow in an Excel table. As you can see the summary holds quite a bit of information. First, it lets us know we have 891 observations, or passengers, to analyze here:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Int64Index: 891 entries, 0 to 890\n",
    "\n",
    "Next it shows us all of the columns in `DataFrame`. Each column tells us something about each of our observations, like their `name`, `sex` or `age`. These colunms  are called a features of our dataset. You can think of the meaning of the words column and feature as interchangeable for this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each feature it lets us know how many values it contains. While most of our features have complete data on every observation, like the `survived` feature here: \n",
    "\n",
    "    survived    891  non-null values \n",
    "\n",
    "some are missing information, like the `age` feature: \n",
    "\n",
    "    age         714  non-null values \n",
    "\n",
    "These missing values are represented as `NaN`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take care of missing values:\n",
    "The features `ticket` and `cabin` have many missing values and so canâ€™t add much value to our analysis. To handle this we will drop them from the dataframe to preserve the integrity of our dataset.\n",

    "#### Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained by Wikipedia:\n",
    ">In statistics, logistic regression or logit regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable (a dependent variable that can take on a limited number of values, whose magnitudes are not meaningful but whose ordering of magnitudes may or may not be meaningful) based on one or more predictor variables. That is, it is used in estimating empirical values of the parameters in a qualitative response model. The probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled, as a function of the explanatory (predictor) variables, using a logistic function. Frequently (and subsequently in this article) \"logistic regression\" is used to refer specifically to the problem in which the dependent variable is binaryâ€”that is, the number of available categories is twoâ€”and problems with more than two categories are referred to as multinomial logistic regression or, if the multiple categories are ordered, as ordered logistic regression.\n",
    "Logistic regression measures the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which are usually (but not necessarily) continuous, by using probability scores as the predicted values of the dependent variable.[1] As such it treats the same set of problems as does probit regression using similar techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The skinny, as explained by yours truly:\n",
    "Our competition wants us to predict a binary outcome. That is, it wants to know whether some will die, (represented as a 0), or survive, (represented as 1). A good place to start is to calculate the probability that an individual observation, or person, is likely to be a 0 or 1. That way we would know the chance that someone survives, and could start making somewhat informed perdictions. If we did, we'd get results like this:: \n",
    "\n",
    "![pred](https://raw.github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/images/calc_prob.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "(*Y axis is the probability that someone survives, X axis is the passengerâ€™s number from 1 to 891.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "While that information is useful it doesnâ€™t let us know whether someone ended up alive or dead. It just lets us know the chance that they will survive or die. We still need to translate these probabilities into the binary decision weâ€™re looking for. But how? We could arbitrarily say that our survival cutoff is anyone with a probability of survival over 50%. In fact, this tactic would actually perform pretty well for our data and would allow you to make decently accurate predictions. Graphically it would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![predwline](https://raw.github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic/master/images/calc_prob_wline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If youâ€™re a betting man like me, you donâ€™t like to leave everything to chance. What are the odds that setting that cutoff at 50% works? Maybe 20% or 80% would work better. Clearly we need a more exact way to make that cutoff. What can save the day? In steps the **Logistic Regression**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A logistic regression follows the all steps we took above but mathematically calculates the cutoff, or decision boundary (as stats nerds call it), for you. This way it can figure out the best cut off to choose, perhaps 50% or 51.84%, that most accurately represents the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three cells below show the process of creating our Logitist regression model, training it on the data, and examining its performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define our formula for our Logit regression. In the next cell we create a regression friendly dataframe that sets up boolean values for the categorical variables in our formula and lets our regression model know the types of inputs we're giving it. The model is then instantiated and fitted before a summary of the model's performance is printed. In the last cell we graphically compare the predictions of our model to the actual values we are trying to predict, as well as the residual errors from our model to check for any structure we may have missed."
